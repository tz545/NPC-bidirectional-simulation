This folder contains add-on functions to LAMMPS (11Aug17 version), and includes:

1. pair_lj_special implements the shifted LJ potential as described in the methods section of the manuscript for differently-sized atoms
2. fix_passage outputs the mean first passage times and whether each trajectory within the defined interval exited on the side corresponding to a "successful translocation"
3. fix_flux_boundary calculates the flux of atoms through a semi-periodic boundary wall
